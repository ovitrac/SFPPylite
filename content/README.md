### 🚀 What is SFPPy-Lite?

SFPPy-Lite is a **lightweight, browser-based preview** of the full SFPPy framework.
It’s built on [**JupyterLite**](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/), which runs Python entirely in WebAssembly — so you can try the tools **instantly**, right in your browser.



**Access the full SFPPy framework for production**:
