# VERSION.txt
# This file defines the version of SFPPy, used across both Bash and Python scripts.
# Only the first non-commented line is read, which must contain the version as a string.
# Example: version="XX.YY.ZZ"
#
# Format:
# - Lines starting with '#' are ignored as comments.
# - The version string should follow the format: version="major.minor.patch" (e.g., version="1.00.0").
# - The version format is free-form but must be enclosed in double quotes.
#
# Notes:
# - This file is critical for consistent version/documentation management in SPFFy.
# - If missing, an error will be raised, and instructions to recreate it will be displayed.
#
# For developers, to read version use:
# in Bash: __version__=$(grep -m 1 '^version=' "$version_file" | sed -E 's/version\s*=\s*"([^"]+)"/\1/')
# in Python: match = re.match(r'^version\s*=\s*"(.*?)"$', line); if match: __version__=match.group(1)
#
#
#   List of versions:
#       - 1.20: full release
#	- 1.30: second release
#	- 1.37: third release, cloud ready
#	- 1.40: fourth release, inline with SFPPylite
