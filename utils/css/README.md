# CSS Directory for SFPPy Reports

This directory stores stylesheets used for generating project reports and documentation.

## Usage
- Include CSS files used for Markdown-to-HTML conversion, such as `sfppy.css`.
- Organize stylesheets based on their purpose or target output (e.g., backup reports, documentation).

## Notes
- The main CSS file, `sfppy.css`, is designed for the backup report and is included in the generated HTML files.
- Ensure that the stylesheets are compatible with common HTML structures.
