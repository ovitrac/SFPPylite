### 🚀 What is SFPPy-Lite?

🌐**SFPPy-Lite** is a **lightweight, browser-based preview** of the full SFPPy framework.  
Built on [**JupyterLite**](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/), it runs Python via WebAssembly using [**Pyodide**](https://pyodide.org/).  
This means you can explore the **SFPPy’s core functionalities** **instantly**, directly from your browser — **no installation required**.
